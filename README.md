# food-bridge

Food-Bridge works towards eradicating hunger by connecting people who need food and people who have extra food to donate.

The surplus food from local household, restaurants, parties should not go waste, so we take their food and distribute it among people who are in need.
Our volunteers pick up food from your doorstep. You can be part of this good cause.

Let us try and not let anyone sleep on an empty stomach.
